# Getting Started with Create React App

I've deployed the frontend application (React) using PM2 and hosted it with Nginx. Below, you'll find relevant screenshots of the configuration.

Frontend URL: You can access the frontend at https://myapp.trackier.xyz/
CI/CD Pipeline: The pipelines are configured and accessible at Jenkins URL https://jenkins.trackier.xyz/login?from=%2F
